- 👋 Hi, I’m @natsaintjuste50!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and more about data science, anaytics, and graphic design (perharps) while gaining AI skills. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ways on which I can become an AI freelancer with the chance of intergrating AI with graphic design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help with my goal in learning more about coding through pragrams like C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly Phyton for my skillset.
- 📫 You can reach me through email whic is at nathaliesaintjuste60@gmail.com.
